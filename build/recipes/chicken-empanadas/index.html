<section class='post-content'><p>Mom (Grandma Susan) spent months working on all of the empanada recipes which were all unveiled at Thanksgiving 2019. Going forward we will be expecting these at either Thanksgiving or Christmas (or both). You would be doing yourself a disservice if you did not also make <a href="/recipes/peruvian-aji/" rel="nofollow">Ají</a> and <a href="/recipes/peruvian-onion-sauce/" rel="nofollow">Peruvian Onions</a> to go along with these.</p>

<p>Yield: about 15 empanadas</p>

<hr>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="/recipes/empanada-pastry">Empanada Pastry Recipe</a> prepared and cut into fifteen 6” rounds—can be made ahead and frozen between parchment. Bring to room temp in single layer while preparing the filling.</li>
<li>1 medium yellow onion, diced small -— root &amp; stem ends and skins reserved</li>
<li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (approx. 1 ¾ lb.)</li>
<li>1 ½ cups chicken stock</li>
<li>2 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>4 garlic cloves, finely minced</li>
<li>2 teaspoons <a href="https://www.savoryspiceshop.com/spice-blends/peruvian-chili-lime-seasoning" rel="nofollow">Peruvian Lime Chili Seasoning</a> or a mild chili powder</li>
<li>30 Kalamata olives, sliced length-wise in half</li>
<li>60 raisins</li>
<li>3-4 hard-boiled eggs, sliced</li>
<li>1 raw egg blended with 1 Teaspoon water to make an egg wash</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: This is the recipe Grandma Susan used for Thanksgiving, knowing that kids would eat empanadas, and not like
them spicy. You can definitely increase the level of spice by adding more chili powder.</p>

<hr>

<p>Directions</p>

<ol>
<li>Peel and dice onion. Reserve the skins and both ends of the onion.</li>
<li>Peel and mince garlic.</li>
<li>In a medium frying pan, bring chicken stock with reserved onion skins and ends to boil. Add chicken
breasts to broth, turn heat to low, and simmer gently for 15-20 m. If chicken is very large, turn half-way
through. Chicken should be just cooked through. Don’t overcook.</li>
<li>Remove chicken from pan and rest until cool enough to handle. When cool, shred the chicken.</li>
<li>Strain and reserve chicken broth. You should have between 1 and 1 ¼ c. broth. If not, add more broth.</li>
<li>Wipe out pan and heat olive oil. Add onion and a large pinch of salt, and sauté until soft. Add garlic and
sauté another minute or so. Add the chili seasoning and 1/8 to ¼ t. pepper.</li>
<li>Add reserved chicken broth and simmer until reduced. Take a spoon and run it across the bottom of the
pan. When a “path” is left, and the liquid is slow to re-populate the pan, turn off the heat.</li>
<li>Add the shredded chicken and stir to fully incorporate. Taste for salt and seasonings.</li>
<li>Take each empanada round and brush edges with egg wash. Place 2-3 T. chicken in 6” round empanada
round. Add 1 slice boiled egg, 4 raisins, and 4 Kalamata olive halves to each. The empanada rounds are
very pliable, so if needed, you can pick up a round and gently stretch to fold over and seal. Crimp with a
fork to seal. Brush egg wash on the top of empanada.</li>
<li>Rest filled empanadas in fridge while the oven heats to 400. Bake empanadas for 20-30 m. or until nicely
browned. Let rest for 10 m. and serve. Serve with ají.</li>
</ol>

<p>Uncooked empanadas can be frozen for up to 3 months. Freeze them in a single layer before placing in a
freezer safe baggie or container. When ready to use, remove from freezer and place directly into a 400
degree oven. Cook time may need to be increased slightly.</p>
