Instructions:

Cut slits in the pork loin and stuff garlic cloves in the slits. You don't need to use the whole clove. Salt and pepper the pork loin.

You can either cook this on the stove top or in the oven, although stovetop is preferred. If using the stovetop, sear the loin on all sides in a hot cast iron pan and then cook, rotating often, until the loin reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees. If using the oven preheat the oven to 350 and cook until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees. If using the stove top 

Warm rolls. Slice cooled pork as thinly as possible. Make into sandwiches adding a generous portion of onion sauce, ají, and/or Papas sauce.
