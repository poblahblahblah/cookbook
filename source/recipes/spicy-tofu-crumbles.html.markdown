We've tried to make tofu palatable for years and always come up disappointingly short. This recipe is quick and easy, coming together while your rice is cooking.

Serve with your choice of rice and vegetables.

Ingredients:

> * 1 pound extra-firm tofu, sliced ¾ inch thick
> * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
> * 1 Fresno chile, thinly sliced
> * 3 tablespoons soy sauce
> * 2 tablespoons mirin
> * 2 tablespoons Sriracha or gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
> * 2 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar
> * 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
> * 1 teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger

Instructions:

1. Arrange tofu slices in a single layer on a paper towel–lined plate and cover with a few more paper towels. Press down firmly on tofu with your hands to expel excess liquid.

1. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high. Cook tofu, turning once, until browned, 7–10 minutes total. If you want a firmer, chewier texture, cook the tofu for 5-10 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate and let cool.

1. Meanwhile, whisk chile, soy sauce, mirin, Sriracha, vinegar, sesame oil, and ginger in a medium bowl to combine.

1. Crumble tofu into small pieces and add to bowl; toss to combine.
