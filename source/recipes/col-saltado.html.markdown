Mom's (Grandma Susan) favorite Saltado. Relatively quick, super easy, and a family favorite. Very popular for Birthdays.

For meat eaters there is [Lomo Saltado](/recipes/lomo-saltado) which can use either chicken or beef. You can also include meat in this dish as well.

If you make [Aji](/recipes/peruvian-aji) to go along with this add the leftover lemon juice to the cooking water to further flavor the rice.

Serves 6-8.
