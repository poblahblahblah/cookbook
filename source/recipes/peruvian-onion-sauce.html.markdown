A great topping for [Butifaras Limeñas](/recipes/butifaras-limenas/), among other things.

Ingredients:

> * 12 white onions, sliced as thinly as possible
> * 1 cup rock salt
> * [Peruvian Aji](/recipes/peruvian-aji/) or [Original Peruvian Aji](/recipes/original-peruvian-aji/) to taste

---

Instructions:

Place onions in a large pot, sprinkle with rock salt, fill pot with hot water. (Mom (Loretta) always said she didn’t like to put in boiling water, because you aren’t supposed to cook the onions, but I like to put either boiling or almost boiling water on mine, as I like them softer than using just hot tap water. Your choice. If you use just hot water, rub the onions between your hands.) Let stand 10-20 minutes.

Pour off the salt water, and rinse thoroughly with cold water. Onions should be limp. Carefully add aji to taste.
