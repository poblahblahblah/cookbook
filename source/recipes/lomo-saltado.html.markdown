Relatively quick, super easy, and a family favorite. Very popular for Birthdays.

Mom's (Grandma Susan) favorite version of this is the vegetarian version, [Col Saltado](/recipes/col-saltado).

If you make [Aji](/recipes/peruvian-aji) to go along with this add the leftover lemon juice to the cooking water to further flavor the rice.

Serves 6-8.
