This is a pretty solid chickpea recipe that we find ourselves making fairly often.

---

Ingredients:

> * 1 lb. dried chickpeas, soaked overnight, drained
> * 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
> * 6 garlic cloves, crushed
> * 2 3x1" strips lemon zest
> * ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
> * Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper

---

Instructions:

Combine chickpeas, onion, garlic, lemon zest, oil, and a couple big pinches of salt in a large pot. Add 2 quarts water and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally and replacing any water that evaporates, until chickpeas are tender, about 2 hours. Taste and season generously with salt and pepper. Let cool.
