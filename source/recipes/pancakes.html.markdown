Instructions:

1. In a large bowl combine the dry ingredients together and thoroughly mix to combine.

1. In a separate bowl combine the wet ingredients together and thoroughly mix to combine.

1. Pour the contents of the wet bowl into the dry bowl. Mix to combine, no more than 20-25 stirs. The batter should be thick and chunky.

1. Preheat your pan or griddle over medium temperature and add a generous pad of butter.

1. Once the butter is melted, scoop a generous amount of the batter onto the griddle. This should be pretty thick, maybe 1/2 inch or so thick.

1. Cook until crispy. Flip and cook the other side until crispy.
