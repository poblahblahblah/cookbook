What you should do with the turkey carcass after Thanksgiving.

Mom (Grandma Susan) first made a version of this back in 1995 (or so), but found the Rick Bayless recipe and that was even better.  A family favorite.

### Getting Started
Slice the tortillas into 1/8-inch wide strips. Heat 1/3 c. oil in an
8 to 9-inch skillet over medium high heat. When hot, add about ½ of the tortilla
strips and fry, turning frequently, until crisp. Remove with slotted spoon and drain
on paper towels. Repeat until all tortilla strips are fried.

Cut the chiles into rough 1-inch squares using kitchen shears. Reduce the heat
under the oil to medium-low, let cool a bit, then fry the squares briefly to toast them,
about 3-4 seconds, immediately remove and drain on paper towels. Then place ½
the chiles in a small bowl, cover with hot water and let rehydrate for 30 minutes,
stirring regularly to ensure even soaking. Drain and discard the water. Set aside the
remaining fried chiles for garnish.

While the chiles are soaking, roast the unpeeled garlic on an ungreased griddle or
heavy skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until blackened in spots and
soft, about 15 minutes. Cool, then slip off the papery skins.

Roast the tomato on a baking sheet 4 inches below a very hot broiler until blackened
and blistered on one side, about 6 minutes; flip and broil the other side. Cool, then
peel, collecting any juices.

### Simmering the Broth
In a medium sized (4 quart) pot, heat the remaining 1 T of
oil over medium low heat. Add the onion and fry until brown, about 10 minutes.
Place the re-hydrated chiles in a food processor or blender along with the roasted
garlic, tomato and 1 cup of the broth. Puree until smooth. Raise the temperature
under the pot to medium-high, and when noticeably hotter, press the tomato-chile
puree through a medium mesh strainer into the fried onion. Stir for several minutes
as the mixture thickens and darkens. Mix in the remaining 5 cups of broth, then
simmer uncovered over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally for 30 minutes.

Season with salt.

### Finish the Soup
Set out the garnishes. Make mounds of the shredded chicken or turkey, fried tortilla
strips, fried chiles, cheese and lime on a large platter. Just before serving, reheat
the soup (if necessary), ladel into bowls and pass the platter of garnishes for each
guest to use al gusto.

#### Advance Preparation
The soup can be prepared several days ahead. The fried
tortillas will keep for a day wrapped in foil on the counter. Reheat the broth and set
out the garnishes just before serving.

#### Other Notes
I think I always added frozen corn, and sometimes diced potatoes to
this recipe. Rick Bayless adds 4 cups of loosely packed, thinly sliced chard leaves,
about 8 ounces.
