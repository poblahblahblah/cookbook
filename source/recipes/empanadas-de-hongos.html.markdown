Mom (Grandma Susan) spent months working on all of the empanada recipes which were all unveiled at Thanksgiving 2019. Going forward we will be expecting these at either Thanksgiving or Christmas (or both). You would be doing yourself a disservice if you did not also make [Ají](/recipes/peruvian-aji/) and [Peruvian Onions](/recipes/peruvian-onion-sauce/) to go along with these.

Yield: about 15 empanadas

Directions

1. Peel and dice onion
1. Peel and mince garlic
1. In a medium frying pan, heat oil and butter. Add onions, and sauté until tender.
1. Add quartered mushrooms and sauté until tender. Add garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes. Add thyme.
1. Add broth and simmer until reduced. Take a spoon and run it across the bottom of the pan. When a
“path” is left, and the liquid is slow to re-populate the pan, turn off the heat and add cream. If sauce is too
thin, gently simmer (do not boil) until reduced
1. Taste for salt and seasonings.
1. Take each empanada round and brush edges with egg wash. Place 2-3 Tablespoons mushroom mixture in 6”
empanada round. The empanada rounds are very pliable, so if needed, you can pick up a round and
gently stretch to fold over and seal. Crimp with a fork to seal. Brush egg wash on the top of empanada.
1. Pierce each empanada with one or two small knife cuts, to assist venting.
1. Rest filled empanadas in fridge while the oven heats to 400. Bake empanadas for 20-30 minutes or until nicely
browned. Let rest for 10 minutes and serve. Serve with ají and Peruvian onion sauce.


Uncooked empanadas can be frozen for up to 3 months. Freeze them in a single layer before placing in a
freezer safe baggie or container. When ready to use, remove from freezer and place directly into a 400
degree oven. Cook time may need to be increased slightly.
