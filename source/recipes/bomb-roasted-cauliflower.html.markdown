> * 1/2 tsp. black pepper
> * 1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt, divided

### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
1. Toss together cauliflower florets and olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet.
1. Stir together garlic powder, cumin, black pepper, cayenne, and salt in a small bowl. Sprinkle over cauliflower, and toss until evenly coated. Spread mixture in a single layer.
1. Roast in preheated oven until cauliflower is slightly charred and tender-crisp, turning once halfway through baking, about 25 minutes.
