Instructions:

1. Put a big pot on the stove on medium. Pour in the oil. When it's hot, toss in the onions, garlic, jalapeno, and shallots and stir them around until soft.
2. Toss in the ground meat. Salt and pepper the ground meat in the pot. Sautee the meat until it's good and brown.
3. Add the tomatoes, beans, corn, beer, broth,  sugar, cumin, chili powder, fennel seed, vinegar, and Frank's. Bring it to a simmer. Half cover the pot and leave it on low medium heat for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally and always tasting.
4. The liquid in the pot should reduce into a nice, thick stew. If necessary at the end, turn up the heat to reduce. Dip in a chip to see if the chili sticks to it. If it does, it's ready to serve.
