### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400F/200C. Toss the diced pumpkin in 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil and some salt and pepper. Place on a lined oven tray and bake for 25-30 minutes, until the pumpkin is cooked through and is golden brown.
1. Place arugula in a large salad bowl. Top with cooked pumpkin, cooked grain, pomegranate seeds, feta and pine nuts.
1. Toss to combine, adding extra feta and pomegranate on top for looks.

### Salad Dressing
1. Combine all the ingredients in a small jar and shake until well combined.
1. If you know youâ€™re eating all the salad at once, pour the salad dressing over the salad and serve! OR, to keep for a later date (like meal prep), keep the salad dressing in a separate container and use as required.
