Thanksgiving was coming up and Madeline wanted to prepare a vegetarian dish that she would be excited about. This caught her eye, and after making it once decided it would be a part of every Thanksgiving.

Also works with sourdough bread.

Makes 12 servings

Ingredients:

> * 1 large loaf of challah or brioche
> * 2 cups celery, diced
> * 2 cups onion, diced
> * 2 cups cremini mushroom, diced
> * 8-10 sprigs thyme, chopped
> * 3 sprigs rosemary, chopped
> * 1/4 cup chopped flat leaf parsley
> * 3 cups vegetable stock, preferably homemade
> * 3 ounces butter
> * 4 ounces melted butter
> * 1 teaspoon salt
> * 1 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground

---

Instructions:

1. Cut the challah into 1" cubes. Leave the cubes out on a parchment lined sheet pan on the counter to get stale, at least overnight, and preferably 2 days.
2. Melt 3 oz. of butter in a large heavy saute pan. Saute the onions until wilted, add the herbs, celery and mushrooms and cook until just slightly cooked through.
3. In a large bowl, combine bread cubes, vegetables, melted butter and vegetable stock, and salt and pepper. Test for seasoning and adjust.
4. Press stuffing into a large buttered baking dish. Cover with buttered parchment, and then foil. At this point, the stuffing can be held for several hours, but should be at room temperature before baking.
5. Bake at 350 for 45-55 minutes, the last 10-15 minutes without the foil and parchment, to crisp the surface.
