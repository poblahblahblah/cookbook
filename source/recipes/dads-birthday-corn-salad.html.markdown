A favorite at Dad's 70th. Scales up well for a large group.

Ingredients:

> * 4 corn cobs, roasted nicely on a grill (with brown and dark kernels)
> * 1/4 small red onion, chopped finely
> * 2 jalapeÃ±os de-veined and de-seeded, chopped finely
> * 1/4 cup of crumbled feta or cotija cheese (your preference)
> * Olive Oil
> * 1 Lime, juiced

You can (and probably should) make everything a day or two ahead of time, you don't have to. If you do make it ahead of time, don't add the feta or cotija until you are ready to serve.

1. Dress with olive oil, lime juice and salt to taste.
