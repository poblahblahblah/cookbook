We usually end up eating this for dinner, but it's a solid breakfast choice. 

To make this vegetarian skip the bacon.

To make this vegan, skip the bacon and the eggs.

Really great with [Momofuku's Soy Sauce Eggs](recipes/momofukus-soy-suace-eggs).

1. In a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon, turning it until it's browned evenly. Remove the bacon from the pan and let drain on paper towels. Once the bacon is cool enough to handle, roughly chop.

1. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the sesame oil until shimmering. Add 2 of the sliced green onions, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.

1. Stir in the cooked rice, breaking up any large clumps. Add the soy sauce, rice vinegar, bacon, toasted sesame seeds, and crushed red pepper flakes. Stir to fully incorporate the ingredients and cook for 5 minutes, or until warmed through.

1. In a non-stick skillet over medium heat, add the butter. Crack the eggs into the skillet and immediately cover the pan with a lid. Cook until the egg white is cooked through and the egg yolk is barely set, approximately 5 minutes.

1. Place a fried egg on top of each bowl of breakfast fried rice and garnish with the remaining sliced green onion. Serve immediately, being sure to break the yolk over the rice so it can act like a sauce.
