These days this is the Peruvian aji recipe that we make most often. It's very similar to our favorite Peruvian restaurant's aji recipe in Southern California, especially since they were nice enough to give us a few pointers.

Ingredients:

>  * 1 head of iceberg lettuce
>  * 3 leaves of romaine lettuce
>  * 7-8 Serrano Peppers (I leave seeds in)
>  * 5-7 cloves of garlic (I count larger cloves as 2)
>  * 1/8 teaspoon of cumin
>  * 3/4 - 1 cup of olive oil or soybean oil
>  * plenty of salt and pepper (more than you think you should)

Instructions:

Combine in a food processor forever until smooth. I've found that right out of the food processor it's very airy, so we usually make it the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight, although this is not necessary.
