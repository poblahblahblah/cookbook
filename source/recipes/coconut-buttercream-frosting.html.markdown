medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 5 minutes.

moistened. Gradually add in the remaining sugar, one cup at a time, mixing well after each
addition. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.

1. And the salt and the coconut milk, one tablespoon at a time, beating on medium speed until
fully incorporated. You may need more or less of the coconut milk depending on how strong you
would like the flavor.

1. Turn the speed up to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy. Scrape down the sides of
the bowl as needed.
