I originally got this recipe from the DVD extras of "The Mexican". I don't know where Robert Rodriguez got it from.

I tried to use chicken instead of pork for some chicken-only friends and it was awful - the fat that the pork provides is absolutely necessary.

Ingredients:

>  * 5 pounds pork butt, cut into 2 inch cubes
>  * banana leaves (optional, but highly recommended)
>  * ½ cup orange juice
>  * ½ cup vinegar
>  * 2 tablespoons of salt (skip the salt if using premade achiote paste)
>  * juice of 5 lemons
>  * 8 cloves garlic
>  * 2 habanero peppers, chopped
>  * 1 tablespoon of tequila

Annatto paste (achiote):
>  * 5 tablespoons annatto seeds
>  * 2 teaspoons of cumin
>  * 1 tablespoon of black peppercorns
>  * 8 piece of allspice
>  * 1/2 teaspoon of cloves

Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 325° F

1. In a blender, blend annatto paste and the rest of the ingredients except banana leaves and pork.

1. In a large bowl mix pork and annatto mixture until pork is evenly coated.

1. Line a deep roasting pan with banana leaves, put the pork mixture and cover with another layer of banana leaves. Cover tightly with tin foil and bake in a 325° F oven for 4 hours.
