During the COVID-19 lockdown a friend bought us the last bag of flour in the store - self-rising flour. We were very pleasantly surprised by how good it turned out.

Serve sliced, covered with butter and/or jam.

Instructions:

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400F. Grease 8.5 x 4.5 inch nonstick loaf pan.

1. Stir flour and sugar together in a large bowl. Stir in beer and mix until smooth dough forms. Transfer dough to prepared pan. Bake until the top is light golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out with no crumbs attached. This should be 35-40 minutes.

1. Transfer pan to write rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Remove loaf from pan and let cool completely on rack.
