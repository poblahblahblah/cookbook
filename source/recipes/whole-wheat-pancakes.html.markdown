During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 we found ourselves with a lot of whole wheat flour and non-dairly milks. We went through a few recipes (and pre-made mixes) and we finally settled on this as the best bang for our buck.

Ingredients

> * 1 cup white whole wheat flour or regular whole wheat flour
> * 1 tablespoon baking powder (not baking soda!)
> * ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
> * ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt
> * ⅔-1 cup milk of choice
> * 1 large egg
> * 2 tablespoons maple syrup or honey, plus more for serving
> * 2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter or coconut oil
> * ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
> * Optional toppings: sliced banana, maple syrup, peanut butter or almond butter

Instructions:

1. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. Whisk to blend.

1. In a smaller bowl, combine the ⅔ cup milk, mashed banana, egg, maple syrup, butter and vanilla. Whisk until blended. Pour the liquid mixture into the flour mixture and mix just until combined. The mixture should be fairly thick, but if it's too thick add more milk.

1. Preheat electric griddle to 350F, or start heating your cast iron pan.

1. Using a ⅓-cup measuring cup, scoop the batter onto the hot skillet, leaving a couple of inches around each pancake for expansion. Cook until small bubbles form on the surface of the pancakes, 2 to 3 minutes (you’ll know it’s ready to flip when about ½-inch of the perimeter is matte instead of glossy).

1. Flip the pancakes, then cook until lightly golden on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat the process with the remaining batter, adding more butter or oil and adjusting the heat as necessary.

1. Serve immediately or keep warm in a 200 degree Fahrenheit oven. If desired, top individual servings with a spread of peanut or almond butter and/or sliced bananas, and serve with more maple syrup or honey on the side.
