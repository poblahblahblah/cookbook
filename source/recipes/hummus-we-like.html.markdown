This recipe is *very* loosely based on the recipe from Keppos Street Kitchen in Sydney, Australia. Over time we've tweaked a few things to our taste.

As listed in the ingredients list, you should make a batch of [Quite Possibly the Best Chickpeas](/recipes/best-chickpeas) ahead of time and use that.

If you have a good blender you should use that, but be prepared to be blending for a while. A food processor will work, although we've found that the texture is not as good.

The cream of tartar, according to America's Test Kitchen, will help the lemon flavor shine whilst using less lemon juice and peel. If you are not using lemon, do not add the cream of tartar.

Getting a good tahini is pretty important for this recipe. Here is a list of Tahinis that we *do not* recommend:

> * Trader Joes. It tastes oddly like peanut butter.

Ingredients:

> * 1 batch of [Quite Possibly the Best Chickpeas](/recipes/best-chickpeas), onion, lemon peels, and garlic cloves removed
> * 5 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped
> * 100 g (3.5 oz) raw tahini
> * 1 teaspoon salt
> * small pinch of ground cumin
> * Juice of 1 lemon
> * Zest of 1 lemon
> * 1/4 tsp cream of tartar

Instructions:

1. Juice the lemon, put into small bowl.

1. Chop garlic and place into lemon juice bowl. Let sit for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, zest the lemon, removing as much pith as possible.

1. Remove garlic solids from lemon juice and discard garlic solids.

1. Put the chickpeas in the blender and blend to a smooth paste; this can take anything from 5 to 10 minutes. Add the tahini, salt, lemon juice, lemon zest, cream of tartar, and cumin and continue to blend, occasionally scraping down the sides and adding water if necessary.

1. Store in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 5 days.
