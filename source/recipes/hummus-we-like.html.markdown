This recipe is *very* loosely based on the recipe from Keppos Street Kitchen in Sydney, Australia. Over time we've tweaked a few things to our taste.

As listed in the ingredients list, you should make a batch of [Quite Possibly the Best Chickpeas](/recipes/best-chickpeas) ahead of time and use that.

If you have a good blender you should use that, but be prepared to be blending for a while. A food processor will work, although we've found that the texture is not as good.

Getting a good tahini is pretty important for this recipe. Here is a list of Tahinis that we *do not* recommend:

> * Trader Joes. It tastes oddly like peanut butter.

Ingredients:

> * 1 batch of [Quite Possibly the Best Chickpeas](/recipes/best-chickpeas), lemon peels removed
> * 5 garlic cloves,peeled
> * 200 g (7 oz) raw tahini
> * 1 teaspoon salt
> * pinch of ground cumin
> * Juice of 1 lemon
> * Zest of 1 lemon

Instructions:

Put the garlic in a food processor (don't use a stick blender) with 200ml (7oz) water and blend to a very smooth consistency. Put through a sieve and keep the liquid, discarding the pur√©ed garlic.

Put the chickpeas in the blender and blend to a smooth paste; this can take anything from 5 to 10 minutes. Add the tahini, garlic water, salt, lemon zest, and cumin and continue to blend, ocassionally scraping down the sides and adding water if necessary.

Transfer to a large mixing bowl, add lemon juice and gently whisk in. If you over mix you will introduce too much air and the consistency might be off.

Store in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 5 days.
