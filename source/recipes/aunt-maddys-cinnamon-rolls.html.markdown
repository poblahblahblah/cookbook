1. For the filling, combine brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, cloves, salt, and 1 tablespoon melted butter together in a medium bowl and mix until it resembles wet sand.
1. For the dough, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.
1. Whisk the buttermilk and 2 tablespoons of melted butter together in a separate bowl.
1. Stir buttermilk mixture into the flour mixture until shaggy, about 30 seconds.

1. Sprinkle dough evenly with the filling, leaving 1/2 inch border, and press it firmly into the dough.
