Instructions:

1. Place the chicken pieces on a cutting board with the flesh-side up. Score deeply at 1-inch intervals with a sharp knife. Place in a large rimmed baking dish.

2. Combine cumin, paprika, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne in a small bowl and mix well. Set aside 3 tablespoons of spice mixture. Combine remaining 6 tablespoons spice mixture, 8 cloves garlic garlic, 2 tablespoons ginger, yogurt, 1/2 cup lemon juice, and 1/4 cup salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Pour marinade all over chicken pieces, using hands to coat every surface. cover loosely and refrigerate. Refrigerate and allow to marinate for at least 4 hours and up to 8, turning occasionally.

3. Meanwhile, heat butter or ghee in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until melted and foaming subsides. Add onions, remaining 4 tablespoons grated garlic, and remaining 2 tablespoons ginger. Cook, stirring frequently, until dark and beginning to char in spots, about 10 minutes. Add reserved spice mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and half of cilantro, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan with a spoon. Simmer for 15 minutes, then puree using a hand blender or by transferring to a tabletop blender in batches.
    
4. Stir in cream and remaining quarter cup lemon juice. Season to taste with salt, then set aside until chicken is cooked. <b>Note: I adapted this recipe from Serious Eats. However, I tasted the sauce at this point and found it far too bland. I added salt and quite a bit of the spices in the marinade (cayenne, cumin, coriander, and turmeric to taste).</b>

5. TO COOK ON THE GRILL: When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and spread the coals evenly over half of coal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Wipe excess marinade off chicken and place over hot side of grill, flesh-side-down. Grill without moving until well charred, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until second side is charred, another 4 to 5 minutes. (Chicken will not be completely cooked throughâ€”this is ok). Transfer to cutting board and allow to rest 10 minutes. <b>Note: You could also cook this in the oven on broil, but be sure you get a good char.</b>

6. If you used bone-in, remove chicken from bone using a sharp knife and cut into rough bite-sized chunks. If you used boneless, cut into bit-sized chunks. Transfer chicken chunks to pot of sauce. <b>Note: I still thought the sauce was too bland, so I used the chicken marinade and combined it with the sauce. But be sure to heat this well because chicken has been sitting in it all day.</b> Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring frequently, until chicken is just cooked through, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining cilantro, then serve immediately with rice, or nan, or broiled cauliflower. It is DELICIOUS. <b>Note: If you added the marinade to the sauce like I did to punch it up, you may need to stir in some plain to tone it down. I did not, but Suze did.</b>
