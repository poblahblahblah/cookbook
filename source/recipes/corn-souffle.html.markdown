A family favorite at Thanksgiving. I never ate this as a kid because it had corn in it.

Ingredients:

> * 2 cups of fresh corn kernels (about 5 ears worth)
> * 1 cup of sour cream
> * 1 cup diced monterey jack cheese
> * 1 4 ounce can of diced green chiles
> * 1/2 cup (1 stick) of butter, melted
> * 2 eggs
> * 1/2 cup flour
> * 1 + 1/2 teaspoon salt

1. Preheat oven to 350F
1. Generously butter 2 quart rectangular casserole dish
1. Puree 1 cup of corn with butter and eggs in a blender or food processor
1. Mix remaining ingredients in a medium bowl, add pureed mixture and mix well.
1. Pour into prepared pan and bake, uncovered, 50-60 minutes.

This may be prepared a day in advance and reheated before serving. It also freezes beautifully; defrost before reheating.
