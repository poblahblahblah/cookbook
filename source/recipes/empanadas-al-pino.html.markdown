Mom (Grandma Susan) spent months working on all of the empanada recipes which were all unveiled at Thanksgiving 2019. Going forward we will be expecting these at either Thanksgiving or Christmas (or both). You would be doing yourself a disservice if you did not also make [Ají](/recipes/peruvian-aji/) and [Peruvian Onions](/recipes/peruvian-onion-sauce/) to go along with these.

Yield: about 15 empanadas

Ingredients:

> * <a href="/recipes/empanada-pastry">Empanada Pastry Recipe</a> prepared and cut into fifteen 6” rounds—can be made ahead and frozen between parchment. Bring to room temp in single layer while preparing the filling.
> * 1 medium yellow onion, diced small
> * 1 lb. ground beef
> * 2 Tablespoons olive oil
> * 4 garlic cloves, finely minced
> * 2 Tablespoons tomato paste
> * 2 teaspoons [Peruvian Lime Chili Seasoning](https://www.savoryspiceshop.com/spice-blends/peruvian-chili-lime-seasoning) or a mild chili powder
> * ½ cup water or broth
> * 30 Kalamata olives, sliced length-wise in half
> * 60 raisins
> * 3-4 hard-boiled eggs, sliced
> * 1 raw egg blended with 1 Tablespoon water to make an egg wash
> * salt and pepper to taste

Note: This is the recipe Grandma Susan used for Thanksgiving, knowing that kids would eat empanadas, and not like
them spicy. You can definitely increase the level of spice by adding more chili powder.

Directions

1. Peel and dice onion.
1. Peel and mince garlic.
1. In a medium frying pan, sauté hamburger meat. Add onions and sauté until tender. Add
garlic and sauté another minute or two. Season with salt and pepper.
1. Add tomato paste, chili powder, and water or broth. Cook until broth/water is thickened.
1. Taste for salt and seasonings.
1. Take each empanada round and brush edges with egg wash. Place 2-3 T. chicken in 6”
round empanada round. Add 1 slice boiled egg, 4 raisins, and 4 Kalamata olive halves to
each. The empanada rounds are very pliable, so if needed, you can pick up a round and
gently stretch to fold over and seal. Crimp with a fork to seal. Brush egg wash on the top of
empanada.
1. Rest filled empanadas in fridge while the oven heats to 400. Bake empanadas for 20-30 m.
or until nicely browned. Let rest for 10 m. and serve. Serve with ají and Peruvian onion
sauce.


Uncooked empanadas can be frozen for up to 3 months. Freeze them in a single layer
before placing in a freezer safe baggie or container. When ready to use, remove from
freezer and place directly into a 400 degree oven. Cook time may need to be increased
slightly.
