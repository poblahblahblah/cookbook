Made this delicious Lime-Cilantro-RIce Saturday.  Both Dad and I loved it. I made it with sautéed/simmered chicken breast.  Added pickled red onions.  Oh my.  Delicious. I think it is worthy of inclusion in our Cookbook.

For the chicken, I seared one large 1/2 chicken breast, well seasoned with salt and pepper. (It was a monster.  Big enough for both of us to have 2 meals each.)

After searing, I added 1/2 c. white wine and 1 c. chicken broth.  I gently simmered until tender.  Took it off the stove, reserving the liquid.  After cooling, I shredded the chicken. And reserved.

Ingredients:

> * 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
> * 1 cups long grained rice, rinsed and drained
> * 1/4 cup chopped onion— recipe called for red, but I only had white
> * 1-2 jalapeños, chopped, seeded and deveined (optional)— to taste  (Although we found cooking the jalapeño with the rice made it quite spicy. Might be better to just add after cooking)
> * 2 cloves garlic, minced
> * 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
> * 1 14.5 oz. can black beans, rinsed and drained (optional, but it was delicious)
> * Reserved Chicken simmered broth, plus enough Better than Bouillon broth to make 3 cups
> * Freshly cracked salt and pepper to taste
> * 1 tablespoons butter (optional)
> * 1/3 cup loosely packed cilantro, chopped
> * 2 tablespoon lime juice

## Step 1

Heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add onions and jalapeños and and saute 3-5 minutes, then add rice and sauté until onions are tender, and rice is a little toasty. Add garlic and cumin and saute 30 more seconds (When you can smell the garlic and cumin, stop!)

## Step 2
Add chicken broth and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for approximately 15-20 minutes or until rice is tender, stirring a couple times towards the end of cooking and covering again.

## Step 3
Remove from heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes-don't peak! Stir in butter to melt (optional, but it was delicious!) and season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in beans, jalapeños (if you didn’t add them earlier), lime juice and cilantro.


Serve rice, with shredded chicken on the side. Add warm tortillas, pickled red onions, avocado, chopped cilantro, chopped jalapeños, pico de gallo, or whatever you have on hand!
