Mom (Grandma Susan) remembers driving along a dark road in Lima, Peru and seeing lots of small hibachi fires along the way.  Grandma Loretta insisted that Grandpa Chuck stop so that she could check it out.  She bought a stick of anticuchos, and declared that they were, “Delicious!”  They’ve been a celebratory meal ever since!
