This is the original family recipe for aji. It has since been replaced, although it is still good.

Ingredients:

> * 1 lb. jalapenos (you can add a few serranos to make it spicier)
> * 1 cup olive oil
> * lemon juice
> * 1 bunch scallions (green onions) thinly sliced
> * small amount of cumin (optional)
> * salt to taste

---

Instructions:

Seed the peppers, WEAR GLOVES, or at least, don't touch the insides or seeds with your hands. You will be sorry if you do. Actually, I usually seed most of the peppers, but keep a few (2-5) whole, minus the stem, of course.

Process in food processor, along with scallions (if you are experimenting, after processing the peppers, I'd add the cumin and lettuce at this point).

Add olive oil, again, very slowly, a few drops at a time. Add until the consistency is correct. You may not need the full amount.

Add lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste.
