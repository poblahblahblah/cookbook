Gluten free because we're pasty.

If you need a frosting recipe, these work very well with the <a href="/recipes/coconut-buttercream-frosting">Coconut Buttercream Frosting</a> recipe.

Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 325ºF. Line a 12 cup muffin pan with baking cups and set aside.

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, baking soda and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk
together the melted coconut oil, honey, eggs, vanilla extract, almond extract and lemon zest until
well combined. Add the wet ingredients to the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix until combined.

1. Pour or scoop the batter evenly into the prepared cupcake tins. Bake for 22 to 25 minutes, until
golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. Let the cupcakes cool in the
pan for about 5 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.

1. Frost the cooled cupcakes as desired!
