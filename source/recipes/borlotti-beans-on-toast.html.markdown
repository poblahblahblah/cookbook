#### Beans
Soak the beans overnight. The next day, drain and rinse well. Put everything into a pot except for the salt. Fill with water to cover by 1 inch. Bring beans to a simmer and skim the foam the rises to the top. Continue to simmer until beans are tender, 30–45 minutes.Right before beans are cooked, add salt. Allow to cool to room temperature.

When beans are cool, purée half of them in a blender with a little bit of the cooking liquid and olive oil. Season with salt.

#### Garlic Oil
Put everything into a cold pan and very slowly bring to a simmer. Once it comes to a simmer, cook for about 10 minutes. You want the garlic to be soft and sweet, not brown and crispy. Allow to cool to room temp.

#### To Finish
In the broiler or on the grill, toast the bread (don’t be afraid to let the edges get a little black). While it’s hot, rub it lightly with the raw garlic clove and drizzle with olive oil.

Top each slice of bread with some of the purée, then the cooked borlotti—or, for easier eating, mix the purée and the beans together, and top the bread with that. Squeeze lemon juice over everything, sprinkle with salt, and drizzle over the sliced garlic and its oil. Enjoy!
