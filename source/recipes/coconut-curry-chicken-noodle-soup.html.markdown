>   * 3 tablespoons curry powder, preferably Malaysian, Thai or Vietnamese
>   * ½ teaspoon paprika
>   * 1 can (14 ounces) unsweetened coconut milk
>   * ½ cup half-and-half
>   * 4 cups chicken stock
>   * ¼ teaspoon ground turmeric
>   * 2 tablespoons fish sauce (use Bragg's liquid aminos if making vegetarian/vegan)
>   * 1 tablespoon sugar, more to taste
>   * About 12 kaffir lime leaves or curry leaves, fresh or frozen (optional)
>   * 8 ounces dried thin rice noodles (bun or vermicelli), or other Asian noodles such as udon or lai fun
>   * Salt to taste
>   * 1 cup bean sprouts
>   * 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro
>   * 2 scallions, cut into thin rings
>   * 2 shallots, thinly sliced and deep fried in vegetable oil until brown (optional)
>   * Quartered limes for serving

Instructions:

1. Heat oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Add onion, ginger and lemon grass and cook, stirring, until softened, about 10 minutes. Do not brown; reduce heat if necessary. Add garlic and chili paste and stir until fragrant. Raise heat, add chicken and stir-fry one minute. Add curry powder and paprika and stir to coat. Then add coconut milk, half-and-half, chicken stock, turmeric, fish sauce, sugar and lime or curry leaves. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 7 minutes.

1. Meanwhile, cook rice noodles in boiling water according to package directions (about 4 minutes). Rinse and drain.

1. Taste broth and adjust seasonings with salt and sugar. Divide noodles into large soup bowls. Bring broth to a boil, then ladle over noodles. Top with bean sprouts, cilantro, scallions and fried shallots, if using. Pass limes and sambal at the table.
