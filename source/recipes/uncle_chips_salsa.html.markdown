Tommy sent this to me a few years ago - apparently he got it from Uncle Chip.

The key thing to this salsa is that it needs to be made the day before you plan to consume.

#### Ingredients

> * 8-10 roma tomatoes (don't use anything but roma)
> * 1 red onion, diced
> * 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced finely
> * 4-6 jalapenos, diced
> * 2 serrano chiles, diced
> * A good sized bunch of cilantro, minced

> * Salt to taste
> * Olive oil to taste

Mix everything together into a large bowl and let sit overnight. Add more salt and olive oil before serving, if necessary.
