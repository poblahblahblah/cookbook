This cookie is in Aunt Maddy's top 5 favorite cookies. If you aren't planning on eating all of the cookies immediately, you can divide the dough and freeze the dough balls individually and bake as needed.

To make the cookie texture a bit more interesting consider using chopping up 4 ounces block chocolate.

Makes 16 cookies.

Instructions:

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 rimless cookie sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in bowl.

1. Whisk sugar, melted butter, egg and yolk, and vanilla in large bowl until combined. Stir in flour mixture until no dry streaks remain. Stir in oats, pecans, coconut, and chocolate chips until fully combined (mixture will be sticky).

1. Lightly spray 1/4-cup dry measuring cup with vegetable oil spray. Drop level 1/4-cup portions of dough onto prepared sheets, staggering 8 portions per sheet and spacing them about 2 1/2 inches apart. Divide any remaining dough among portions.

1. Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until edges are browned and set and centers are puffed with pale, raw spots, 15-17 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Do not overbake.

1. Let cookies cool on sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack and let cool completely before serving. Cookies can be stored in airtight container for up to 3 days.
